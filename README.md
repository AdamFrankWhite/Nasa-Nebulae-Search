### `Development`

Using NASA's API to access its image library, I wanted to create a visually-appealing smooth interface to search and save images. Using fetch() to grab the data, React was again useful in creating card components with differentiated image links. Using CSS's relative and absolute positions, along with transitions made for a pleasant user experience.

The main developmental hurdles was checking to see if an image was already used, to avoid duplicates when randomly populating the images array.
